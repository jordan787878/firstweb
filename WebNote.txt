~Mars Perseverance Photo Booth
Mix mars background to photos! Fun!

~#CountdownToMars Socil
NASA hosts facebook community for the Mars Perseverance Rover Launch.
I apply to join the community, waiting approval.
(update) I was in!

~Andrej Karpathy MIT Technology Review
He employs CNN to allow automated cars to infer the story, namely what is going on, from the image of tradition cameras.

~Adversarial attacks
adversarial attack is manipulation of input data that looks innocuous to a person but fools neural networks.
e.g. random black-white stickers on a stop sign, which did not obscure the sign's clear lettering, can cause the AI to generate a result of speed limit of 45 mph. (showed by Bo Li)
Robustness of the AI.

~Neural Magic
Neural Magic is an algorithm which allows any company to deploy a deep-learning model without the need for specialized hardware (GPU). Shavit recalls, "I realized that a CPU can do what a GPU does.i"
Cons of GPU:
	1. can't operate without CPU.
	2. limited amount of cache memory. (back-and-forth data flow)

~Frictionless Checkout
new store experience by removing the checkout line, interaction with a cashier, and the need to scan and bag items. Customers just walk out after selectin items. Ceiling cameras and shelf sensor determine what customers have selected to buy. Later, an e-receipt appears on their phone.

ALEGION Company: How to prevent loss of inventory during frictionless checkout?

~A concept in psychology is helping AI to better navigate our world
Theory of affordance: when intelligent beings look at hte world they perceive not simply objects and their relationship but also their possibilities. (e.g. when we look at a chair, we know that we can sit on it)
So we can first teach the environment's affordances to robot (can't penetrate wall), then train it to navigate. This approach eliminates the failed trials of moving toward the walls.

~Dust Storms on Mars
Dust storms can often grow into massive behemoths that last several weeks, blanketing the entire planet, and cutting off communication.

~Are we making spacecraft too autonomous?
Darrel Raines: autonomy is key for areas of "critical response time", like the ascent of a rocket after liftoff. Or in instances where the crew might be incapacitated.
Ad Astra, a Houston-based company looking to makee plasma rocket propulsion viable, use automatic software to figure out the optimal frequencies for the heating of argon gas.
But cases of failure due to code happenes!
e.g. Boeing's Starliner falied to make it to the ISS because of a glitch in its internal timer.
Have to have a rigorous software testing program.

~Virgin Orbit's rocket has failed on its first attempt to get into space
LauncherOne rocket failed on May 25 after seven years of development and testing.
After released from a Boeing 747, it ignited and fell into the sea.
The rocket had previouly been dropped from the plane, but this was the first time it was ignited.

~Rockey Lab's 13th launch ends in failure
The vehicle started losing speed and it dropped in altitude on Jult 4.
The anomaly occured at six minute after launch.
Rocket Lab has put 53 spacecraft into low Earth orbit on 12 separate missions.
This was the first major failure for the company.

~NASA and Boeing complete orbital flight test reviews
Three primary anomalies: 2 software coding errors (Mission Elapsed Timer, Service Module Disposal Burn), 1 unanticipated loss of space-to-ground communication capability.
Test and Simulation: need greatedr hardware and software integration testing; using max. amount of flight hardware available; review subsystem behaviors and limitations; address any identified simulation gaps.
Requirements: assessment of all software requirements with multiple logic conditions to ensure test coverage.

~China Yutu-2
Yutu-2 lunar rover found bizzare "gel-like" substance with unusual color at the moon's far side.
