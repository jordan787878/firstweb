Typically, we are intereseted in cases where the plant and the controller are linear and time-invarinat, or can be modeled as such.
Then we can represent components as transfer functions.

Transfer Functions: Laplace Transform of the impulse response of an LTI system when I.C = 0.
High gain feedback control loop reduces:
	1. the sensitivity of the control system to variations in the plant.
	2. the effect of disturbances of the output of a control system.

Modeling Principles:
	1. Indentify the states of the system: positions, velocities, inductor currents, capacitor voltages.
	2. Use physicis to find states derivatives: dx1/dt, dx2/dt, dx3/dt...
	3. organize as dx/dt = f(x,u), y=g(x,u). where x-state vector, u-control input, y-output of measurement.
	4. Matrix Form: x_dot = [A]x + Bu
			y     = [C]x + Du
	5. Linearize if necessary.

Aileron input - Roll angle close loop control: by simply adding a gain value K. While the control works, the result is Oscillatory!

"Approximate" Step Response of a 2nd oreder, two complex poles, no finite zeros system.
	G(s) = wn^2/(s^2+2*zeta*wn*s+wn^3)
From solving the poles of [den], s = -sigma+-j*wd,
We can find: undamped frequency: wn, damping ratio: zeta, negative real part: sigma (zeta = sigma/wn)
From this, the "estimated" time-domain specification is:
	1. rise time: tr = 1.8/wn
	2. Overshoot: Mp = e^(-pi*zeta/sqrt(1-zeta^2)) = fcn(zeta)
	3. Peak time: tp = pi/wd
	4. settling time: ts = 4.6/sigma.
Accordingly, By setting the "time specifications" tr, Mp, ts, yield an allowable region for poles.
	1. wn >= 1.8/tr
	2. zeta >= zeta(Mp), (from Mp-zeta relation)
	3. sigma >= 4.6/ts

What if there are finite zeros??
	H(s) = G(s)*(as+1), 
By H(s) = H0(s)+a*s*H0(s), where H0(s) is the form without zeros.
h(t) = h0(t) + a*d(h0(t))/dt,
[Step response in time domain] =
[Step response in time domain(without zeros)] + a* time derivative of [Step response in time domain(without zeros)]
The zero has small effect while |a*wn| << 1
	1. with a>0, zero in the left-half plane, tends to speed up time response, increase overshoot.
	2. with a<0, zero in the right-half plant (Non-Minimum Phase Zero, NMP zero)
		a) step response is the original step respone "minus" a constant * the derivative.
		b) undesirable effect: initial "wrong way" behavior. (ex/ backing car, to get a backing car to return to a given line,
		   must make the front end go the wrong way first.)

What if there are additional poles?
	H(s) = G(s)* 1/(as+1),
Step response = original response + (1/a)*e^(-t/a)*(sigma(t)), where sigam(t) is the impulse fcn. if sigma(0) = 1, else sigma(t) = 0
Effect: smooth the original step response, increase ts, reduce Mp.

Routh Stability Criterion:
Determine the stability of systems with high order polynomials in [num] (Hard to solve the poles for high order polynominal)
All roots lie in LHP if and only if a certain set of algebraic combinations of the coefficients all have same sign. (left column of Routh array)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBCZBOB3LCA
	ex/ what values of the gain K is the following system stable? G(s) = 1/(s+1)^3, with gain K, close loop.
	    H(s) = KG/(1+KG), [num] = (s+1)^3+K. First column of Routh array [1,3,(8-K)/3,1+K],
	    if K > 8, sign of First column of Routh array = [+,+,-,+] unstable,
	    if K < -1, sigm of First column of Routh array = [+,+,+,-] unstable.

Effect of Noise and Disturbance:
Design our controller, so that the "shape" of the Bode plot of Sensitivity and Complementary transfer function is "such" that represents: reference tracking, noise rejection, and disturbance rejection.
Yet, S & T transfer functions are not independant, relation is S+T=1
Tradeoff between these two!!!
*See figures: Noise & Disturb Block Diagram, Bode Plot_S and _T. 

Followingly, Since the S & T function only depends on C(s), which is the controller's transfer function,
We can directly design the "shape" of C(s), on the Bode plot, so that S & T satisfied tha "shape".
From the "shape" of the open-loop transfer function, C(s)P(s),
We can see the characteristic of the close-loop transfer functions, S & T, which influence reference tracking, noise rejection, and disturbance rejection.
*See figures: Bode Plot PC-T; PC-S; PC-S,T

PID control:
PID describes how the error term is handled.
P- Proportional Control, Kp, simply multiply the error signal by Kp times, change wn -> effect rising time.
D- Derivative Contrl, KD*s, change the damping ratio -> effect overshoot Mp.
I- Integral Control, Ki/s, increase the order of the transferfunction, effect steady-state error.i
*See figure: PID control block diagram, for control structure.
Placing derivative in the feedback path can avoid additional zero effects. 
PID control can make a 2nd order system to meet: rising time, overshoot, and steady-state error requirements!
*See figure: PID control

Root Locus:
Often, it is useful to find the closed-loop poles of a system change as a single parameter is varied. To do this, we use the root locus method.

Lead/Lag Compensator:
What is phase lead? for example: input=sin(t), output=d(sin(t))/dt=cos(t).
Observe that the output is 90 degree leading the input.
And if we get the Bode plot of the transfer fcn (differentiate operation, s),
we can see the phase plot is +90 degree for all input frequncy.
*See figure: What is phase lead?
	differentiate(s) +90 phase
	integral(1/s)    -90 phase
So a zero adds phase, and a pole subtracts phase.
Lead/Lag Compensator = (wp/wz)*(s+wz)/(s+wp)
	Lead: wz < wp
	Lag : wz > wp
*See figure: Lead Compensator_bodeplot

Phase Margin and Damping ratio:
Low PM -> low damping ratio.
When the phase margin is small, the closed-loop system is close to instability.

Root Locus Method:
Watching how the roots move through the s-plane is powerful.
Only one unknown variable in the transfer function.
Be careful when transforming time domain spec into S-domain. Because Damping ratio and Natural frequency are defined for 2nd order system.
*See figure: Root Locus Intro.

Nyquist Stability Criterion:
For a closed loop transfer function of: G/(1+GH).
We can see (1+GH) as num(s)/den(s). Therefore, the closed loop Transfer function becomes: G*den(s)/num(s).
So, If (1+GH) has a "zero" in the RHP, then the closed loop system is unstable.
It is hard to find the poles and zeros if we add 1 to the open loop GH.
However, it is easy to do that in a Nyquist Plot!

Cauchy's Argument Principle:
Mapping from s-plane to w-plane through the transfer function.
*See figure: Caushy's Argument Principle

Nyquist Plot:
A graphical analogy to Ruth Stability Criteria.
	1. Nyquist plot of GH,(open loop)
	2. Count encirclements of -1, in clockwise direction
	3. Figure out how many "more" poles or zeros are in RHP
Equation: z = N + P
	z, number of RHP zeros
	N, number of CW encirclements of -1
	P, number of RHP poles for open loop system.
You must know the open loop poles in order to determine the number of closed loop zeros in RHP.
With Nyquist, have the ability to analyze a system with an unstable open loop plant!
For example, fighter jet.
*See figure: Nyquist Plot Design F16
