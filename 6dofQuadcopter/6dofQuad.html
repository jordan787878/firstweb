<h1>6-Dof Quadcoptor Simulation and Control
</h1>
<p><b>Demo</b><br>
The drone flies in two primary modes: 1) follow mode   2) surrounding mode.<br>
1) Follow mode keeps constant distance to the moving target point (black dots), in the meantime point the camera (blue axis) toward the target point.<br>

2) Surrounding mode keeps surrounding the moving target point, in the meantime point the camera (blue axis) toward the target point<br>

<p>
<b>Current Model</b><br>
6 degree of freedom: X, Y, Z, roll, pitch, yaw<br>
4 control inputs: u1 for thrust, u2, u3, u4 for torque on Xb,Yb,Zb axis.<br>
control limits: u1 smaller than 30 Newton; Torque smaller than 1.2 Nm; angles smaller than 60 degree)<br>
</p>

<p><b>
Equations: Body Frame</b><br>
| F = m(v_dot + wxv)<br>
| M = I*w_dot + w x (I*w)<br>
</p>

<p><b>Current Control</b><br>
Altitdue control: PD control + Mass Feedforward<br>
Position control: cascaded PD loop, outer PD control loop generates the input refecence signal for the inner angle PD control loop .<br>
Yaw Tracker: point the camera (blue axis) toward the target, control the yaw angle.<br>
Target Follow: keep the distance with the target, if the surrounding angular speed is set to zero, than the drone flies in 1st mode. Otherwise, it flies in 2cd mode.<br>
Takeoff flag: now I use clock + Takeoff time to set the takeoff flag.<br>

<b>Command Matrix and Animation</b><br>
<ol>
	<li>Set the initial values of the drone by running the %% Setup Drone section in SetDroneControl.m<br>
		<img src = "Figures/SetDrone.png"></li>
	<li>Use the form of [x,y,z,t] matrix to define the waypoints for the moving target, by running the %% Waypoints for drone section in XYZsignal.m. (you can obtain the WayPts by loading the pre-built waypoint from DroneSignal_movingtarget.mat file)<br>
<img src = "Figures/WayPts.png">
<img src = "Figures/WayPts_prebuilt.png"></li>
	<li>Run the %% Generate signals section in XYZsignal.m to extrapolate the signals.<br>
		<img src = "Figures/GenerateSignals.png"></li>
	<li>Run the simulation of DroneControl.slx</li>
	<li>Run the %% Simulink 3D Animation with Moving Target section in animation.m<br>
