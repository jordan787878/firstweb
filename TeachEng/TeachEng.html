	<h2>State Space:</h2>
	<p><b>Dynamic system can be written in differential equations.</b><br>
	How the system is changing = f(current state)<br>
	Xd = f(X), actually defines stability for linear systems<br>
	Xd = f(X,u), where u = inputs, defines how a system changes<br>
	There are also control techniques that are built on state space models
	(e.g. Kalman filter, LQR, robust, Model Predictive Control)<br>
