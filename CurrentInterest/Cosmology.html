	<b>Dust Storms on Mars</b><br>
	Dust storms can often grow into massive behemoths that last several weeks, blanketing the entire planet, and cutting off communication.<br>
Emirates Mars mission aims to study the martian atmosphere. (Middle East)

	<b>China Yutu-2</b><br>
Yutu-2 lunar rover found bizzare "gel-like" substance with unusual color at the moon's far side.

	<b>A supermassive black hole lit up a collision of two smaller black holes</b><br>
	About 4 billion light-years away, two black holes collided into one other while in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole called J1249+3449.<br>
	Accretion disk: a swirl of stars, gas, and dust that is slowly being sucked toward the black hole's event horizon.<br>
When the two black holes collided, the force sent them, now merged as one, hurtling out of the supermassive black hole's accrestion disk. As the merge black hole sped into space, it lit up the surrounding gas in the disk.

	<b>How did planet get water?</b><br>
	New: "perhaps" oceans might actually form "inside-out", as internal heating helps release liquid water that's trapped in the deeper layer.<br>
Tra: asteroids deliver water during the early days of a star system.

	<b>Moon Dust</b><br>
	NASA: the biggest challenge to lunar operation is the dust. Moon dust is sticky because of its electrostatic charge. When the sun is high and UV radiation is at its peak, the dust is extra charged, and thus extra sticky. When the sun goes down, the dust seems to lose some of its adhesive force.<br>
	In Apollo missions, Dust Detector Experiment (DDE): the power drop of the solar cells can measure the accumulation of the moon dust. Designed by O'Brien.<br>
	Impact on moon probes: Surveyor 3 bright-white surface had turned a tan color after 2.5 years on moon. Ultrafine moon dust embedded all over the microtexture of the paint. But the quesiton is how did the dust cover the Surveyor 3's surface?<br>
Dust storm theory: During sunrise, moon dust levitates and swirl like a storm.

	<b>Measure the chemical composition of distant stars</b><br>
	From the Feynman Lecture Ch31, the dispersion equation tells us if the light frequency ω is very close to ωk then the resonance term (ω2k−ω2) can become small compared with iγkω and the index becomes almost completely imaginary. The absorption of the light becomes the dominant effect.<br>
	This effect gives the dark lines in the spectrum of light which we receive from the sun. The light from the solar surface has passed through the sun’s atmosphere (as well as the earth’s), and the light has been strongly absorbed at the resonant frequencies of the atoms in the solar atmosphere.<br>
	The observation of such spectral lines in the sunlight allows us to tell the resonant frequencies of the atoms and hence the chemical composition of the sun’s atmosphere. The same kind of observations tell us about the materials in the stars.
