	<b>Andrej Karpathy MIT Technology Review</b><br>
	He employs CNN to allow automated cars to infer the story, namely what is going on, from the image of tradition cameras.

	<b>Adversarial attacks</b><br>
adversarial attack is manipulation of input data that looks innocuous to a person but fools neural networks.
e.g. random black-white stickers on a stop sign, which did not obscure the sign's clear lettering, can cause the AI to generate a result of speed limit of 45 mph. (showed by Bo Li)
Robustness of the AI.

	<b>Neural Magic</b><br>
	Neural Magic is an algorithm which allows any company to deploy a deep-learning model without the need for specialized hardware (GPU). Shavit recalls, "I realized that a CPU can do what a GPU does."<br>
	Cons of GPU:<br>
	1. can't operate without CPU.<br>
	2. limited amount of cache memory. (back-and-forth data flow)<br>
	</p>

	<p id="p4">
	<b>Frictionless Checkout</b><br>
	New store experience by removing the checkout line, interaction with a cashier, and the need to scan and bag items. Customers just walk out after selectin items. Ceiling cameras and shelf sensor determine what customers have selected to buy. Later, an e-receipt appears on their phone. (California-based AiFi introduce NanoStore)<br>

	<b>A concept in psychology is helping AI to better navigate our world</b><br>
	Theory of affordance: when intelligent beings look at hte world they perceive not simply objects and their relationship but also their possibilities. (e.g. when we look at a chair, we know that we can sit on it). So we can first teach the environment's affordances to robot (can't penetrate wall), then train it to navigate. This approach eliminates the failed trials of moving toward the walls.

	<p id="p6">
	<b>Goodhart's Law</b><br>
	Once a measure is turned into a target, it ceases to be a good measure.<br>
	Example 1: When Vietnam govern. started to provide cash reward for each rat killed (e.g. counting the rat tails), the number of rats didn't decreased although many people came to claimed the cash reward. People just cut the rats' tails, released the rat so they can reproduce more rats, or even bred rats to cut their tails.<br>
	Example 2: British India reward snake kill.<br>
	Cobra effect: A decision that produces an effect opposite to the initial purpose. (Or Campbell's Laws) <br>
	Example 3: when companies start to focus on a particular KPI (key performance indicator), the quality of that metric deteriorates. Once people understand how they are being measured, the measure becomes useless as people seek to do well on the measure. (e.g. the number of phone calls made a day. how search engine rank websites using the number of links)

	<b>Generative Design</b>

	MaRS Innovation District: Audodesk office and research lab 2015. Use generative design by gathering employee's opinion about preferred work space, work style, and layout.<br>
	A.I. chair: Kartell company, with French designer Philippe Starck, and Autodesk software.<a href="https://www.starck.com/a-i-for-kartell-by-starck-powered-by-autodesk-kartell-p3534" target="_blank"><i>learn more</i></a><br>
	Car chasis: Hackrod project with Dreamcatcher, able to cal. fuel efficiency, aero dynamics, production cost, material tradeoff. Idea: instead of using simulation "after" to validate the design, they actually use the simulation to design the element itself. instead of specify points and surface, they specify goals and contraints; a higher level. <a href="https://www.autodeskresearch.com/blog/when-iot-meets-generative-design-cars" target="_blank"><i>learn more</i></a><br>
