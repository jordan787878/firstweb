<h1>Mars Perseverance
</h1><p><b>Outline:</b><br>How this mission will pave the way for future human exploration
<br>NASA strategy for exploring Mars
<br>Why we've chosen our landing site & what we are going to find there
<br>What makes this rover different
<br>Update of what we're doing on the spacecraft right now
<br>Update about launch preparation<br></p><p><b>

Highlights:</b><br>Only a month away from launch
<br>Launch in July, because of the alignment; Earth and Mars being on the same side of the Sun. (1 over 26 months)

<br>To go to the mars, we are doing two things
<br>1. building an architecture on the moon for human to sustain a long time (Artemis)
<br>2. Mars robotic rover precursor missions

<br>Perseverance will return the earth eventaully, returning the samples.
Also, it will bring a little helicopter to fly on the Mars. (1st time)<br></p><p><b>

Astrobiology activiies: study of how lives come to be, the environments that can support life, and the search of life beyond the Earth</b><br>Designed to seek signs of past microbial life by collecting and caching rock and soil samples
<br>Look for ancient habitable environments
<br>Monitor environmenal conditions to protect future human explore
<br>Study the record that is preserved in the layers of rock
<br>Demenstrate key tech. of using natural resources on Mars for life support and fuel
(e.g. producing oxygen from the carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere)
<br>First-ever round-trip mission to another planet in our solar system (future, returns the samples)<br></p><p><b>

Sample Return Mission:</b><br>In 2026, a fetch over will be launched to collect the samples and bring them to a rocket that will lauch them into orbit around Mars.
Another orbiter will rendezvous and capture those samples for safe delivery to Earth.
groundwork tech.: autonomous robots, landing large payloads on Mars
(work with the European Space Agency)<br></p><p><b>

Lading site: jezero, a crater located on the inner rim of one of the largest and oldest impact basins.</b><br>Access to some of the oldest rocks in the solar system.
(3.5-4 biliion years old)
<br>NASA thinks jezero was home to different potental habitable environments
jezero is host to the deltas; deltas form when rivers enter open bodies of water
(e.g. deposit rocks, sands, potentially organic carbon, carbonate minerals)<br></p><p><b>

7 scientific instruments:</b><br>Sherlock, Pixel instruments: on the end of the rover's arm; mapping capabilities
<br>Rim facts: in the body; use radar to study the subsurface of Mars
<br>super Kim, mass gamzee:
<br>Moxie: take CO2, converts it to oxygen
<br>Meta: weather package; measure pressure, temperature, humidity

New wheels (6 wheels)
<br>Powerful computer: double duties
<br>1 task: help us get safely down to the surface, taking images of the planet during descent.
<br>2 task: rapid image processing. Can look for hazards and avoid them while traversing (x2 speed compared to curiosity)
<br>23 Cameras: HD videos during entry, descent and landing (1st to see a spacecraft landing on another planet)
<br>Couple Microphones: hear the system operating.

Some Challenges:<br></p><p><b>

There is a team to asseble all the components of the spacecraft</b><br>Test all the instruments as well.
<br>Integrate all the electrical and electrical mechanical components.
<br>Encapsulate the spacecraft.
