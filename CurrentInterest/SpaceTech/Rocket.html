<h1>Rocket Engine
</h1><p><b>SpaceX</b><br>1-Gen: Merlin 1D (active on Falcon 9, Falcon heavy), open-cycle, LOX and RP1 (Kerosene). Sea Level Thrust: 845 kN. Seal Level Specific Impulse: 282 sec. Propellent Densification tech.
<br>2-Gen: Raptor (will be active on starship, currently run on SN5 prototype), full-flow staged combustion cycle. LOX and Liquid Methan. Sea Level Thust: 3,050 kN. Sea Level Specific Impusle: 334 sec. Support deep throttlng to 20% rated thrust. 3D printed components include propellant valves, turbopump parts and injector system.
<br>Control system: cold-gas reaction control system, grid fins, re-entry burn to slow down the speed, S-band and C-band communication systems.
<br>Additive Manufacturing: SpaceX use additive manufacture to reduce cost, eliminate needs to outsource, protect intellectual property, allow for stricker quality control, and reduced times. SpaceX use Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS). Appliction: main engine chamber of escape rocket, the SuperDraco rockets are printed out of Inconel; main oxidizer valve of Merlin 1D; (2 days of manufacture compared to traditional 2 months)<br></p><p><b>

NASA</b><br>Space Launch System (SLS). Use upgrading RS-25 engine from Aerojet Rockeydyne, also known as Space Shuttle main engine. Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Hydrogen. Thrust: 2278 kN. Sea Level Specific Impulse: above 366 sec. Throttling: 67%-109%. Will be active on Artemis mission, Mars mission, deep space misions.<br></p><p><b>

Terms</b><br>Specific Impulse: ISP = Total Impusle/ propellant weight = integral(F*dt)/ (propellant_mass*g0) = Veq/ g0 = F_thrust/ (propellant_m_dt * g0).
<br>Trans-Lunar Injection Maneuver.
<br>S-band Communications.<br></p><p><b>
