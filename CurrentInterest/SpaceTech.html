                <b>Moon Dustbuster</b><br>
		This tech uses electric beam to clean fine-sized moon dust from surfaces. <br>
		The surface cleanliness level can reach about 75-80% on the timescale of 50 sec.<br>

		<b>Orbital Test Vehicle, Boeing, X-37B</b><br>
		The X-37B is an unmanned space test vehicle, which has flown 4 missions until 2020. <br>
		The longest mission lasted 780 days in 2017. <br>
		It is a reusable spacecraft to send back experiments operated in space.<br>
		Like the space shuttle, the solar-power X-37B lauches vertically with the aid of a rocket and cruise bakc to Earth for a runway landing.<br>

		<b>Are we making spacecraft too autonomous?</b><br>
		Darrel Raines: autonomy is key for areas of "critical response time", like the ascent of a rocket after liftoff. Or in instances where the crew might be incapacitated.<br>
		Ad Astra, a Houston-based company looking to makee plasma rocket propulsion viable, use automatic software to figure out the optimal frequencies for the heating of argon gas.<br>
But cases of failure due to code happenes! (e.g. Boeing's Starliner falied to make it to the ISS because of a glitch in its internal timer.) Need to have to have a rigorous software testing program.

		<b>NASA's new moon-bound space suits will get a boost from AI</b><br>
		Biggest upgrade to the space suit is xEMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit)<br>
		xEMU's portable life-support system: handles space suit's power, communications, oxygen supply, temp. regulation.<br>
		Some of the components in an astronaut life-support system will be designed by AI.<br>
		Requirement of life-support system: safe, light, and strong to withstand high g-force.<br>
Instead of spending weeks debating the ideal shape of each widget, they use "Generative Design": feed the AI software a set of requirements for a component's max. size, the weight it has to bear, or the temp. it will be exposed to and let the algo. figure out the rest.
(American company, PTC, made the software)<br>
Different algo. in PTC's AI:<br>
1. generative adversarial networks: game-like approach, two ML algo. face off against one another in competition to design the most opt. component. (same technique used to "generate photos of people who don't exist)<br>
        2. genetic algo. : analogous to natural selection. generate multiple designs, combine them, and then take the best designs of the new generation and repeat.
Advantage: fast and easily generate new design if requirements change in the future. (No waste on enigneer effort)

		<b>NASA Evolvable Systems Technology</b><br>
		A technology to advance engineering design and optimization. It can auto. design and opt. systems. <br>
		Evolvable Systems algorithms are highly adaptable, relatively fast, and can be set up to optimize cost, robustness, and performance by embedding these measures directly into the multi-objective utility functions that comprise the algorithms. Application: fault recovery of FPGA.<br>
		Another Pro: an object can be designed inside the environment it will be deployed (e.g. antennas are designed to achieve a certain performance in free space, yet when an antenna is affixed to a spacecraft, the performance can be greatly affected by reflections of the signal off of the spacecraft.) In our approach, we can evolve the antenna while it is affixed (in simulation) to the target spacecraft.

		<b>MEMS Gyroscope</b><br>
		Measure angular movement using Coriolis effect.<br>
ST's MEMS gyroscopes use a tuning fork configuration: 2 mass constantly oscillates in opposite direction. When an angular velocity is applied, the Coriolis force on each mass also acts in opposite directions. The differential value in capacitance is then used to measure the rotation. When linear accel. is applied, the two mass move in the same direction, and the diff. capacitance is zero.

		<b>Japan's help on Artemis</b><br>
		JAXA could contribute to the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) module, developing life support and power elements.<br>
		It can also hep in  delivering cargo, supplies, and parts to Gateway through its upcoming HTV-X spaceflight vehicle. <br>
		JAXA can procide more lunar landing data by its Investigating Moon (SLIM) mission, testing brand-new precision luncar landing tech. in 2022.<br>
		Japan is also working with Canada and the European Space Agency on Heracles, a robotic transport system that could deliver cargo to the moon or help bring back valuable resources mined there.<br>
		JAXA and Toyota is working on a pressurized lunar rover that astronauts could use to cruise around the moon. <br>

		<b>How Perseverance navigate on Mars by AI</b><br>
		To continuously think and move, Perseverance has two computers. Main computer figures out how to get Perseverance to where it's supposed to go. Second computer makes sure it does not hit any rocks on the way. <br>
		Autonomy is critical because of the signal delay, 22 minutes for light to travel from Earth to Mars. <br>
		Perseverance uses stereo vision to create 3D pictures of the surroundings, and visual odometry software will analyze images separated in time to estimate how far the rover has moved. (No lidar system, because of reliability, energy cost, and bulky)<br>
		Because Mars doesn't have a magnetic field or a thick atmophere to shield the charged particles from the sun, Mars rovers' computers are prone to damaged. Their transistors may turn on and off when they're not supposed to. Need transistors harder to turn on and off. (Xilinx chip) This compromise its computing performance.<br>
		Perseverence's machine vision algorithm must be as lean and efficient as possible, without compromising its accuracy. (developed by Twu, Matties)<br>
		Using the online tool AI4Mars to label terrain features in pictures downloaded from the Red Planet, you can train an artificial intelligence algorithm to automatically read the landscape. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasas-mars-rover-drivers-need-your-help">Nasa's Mars Rover Need Your Help</a>
