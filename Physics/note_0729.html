<h1>Physics, The Thoery of Everything
</h1><p><b>What is the current state of developing the theory of everything?</b><br>Scientists now have two pillar- quantum mechanics, and general relativity.
Qunatum describes the behavior at the min. scale. General relativity describes the behavior of the max. scale. And they both past several experiment tests. Thus, scientists try to combine them and develop a theory that can describe everything. That's what we mean "The theory of everything"
<br>However, scientists have difficulties in this development because some unreasonble terms emerge. (e.g. inf. energy; probability larger than 1)<br></p><p><b>

What's "everything" for scientists?</b><br>Brief history of what is "everything" for scientists:
In ancient time, we figure out how the motion of object moves, but give up why moon doesn't go down. They think the moon as perfect, which was not in the scope of physics.
<br>Newton came and ask "What if we can apply the physics of the motion to the moon?" And we expanded our understanding of motions and gravity.
<br>Yet, again we still can't figure out why the grape is purple, apple is red, namely the color of things until we developed the Maxwell's equations, which gives us the theory of light, color and so on. And then we came to the theory of quantum mechanics to realize why the grape is soft, and the apple is hard.
<br>Now, if we talk about the theory of everyhing, what might be the aspect we leave behind this time? Max Tegmark, "the theroy of information, intelligence, and consciousness. (Intelligence and consciousness is some sort of information processing). We have to study more on intelligence and consciousness because it is deeply rooted to what the "observer" feel, see, and sense. For example, in general relativity, the observer is an inf. small light particles that has no effects on anything else. While in the quantum mechanics, the observer actually affects what it observe. They are totally different."<br></p><p><b>

How can we ensure there's the connection between quatum mech. and general relativity?</b><br>Planck scale, where we get by arranging natural constants (e.g. light constants, Planck energy constants, gravity constants), suggests that at certain energy level, quantum mechanics and gravity has something to do with each other. There has to be some connection. That energy level is so-called Planck energy.
<br>The problem is that with current technology, we can not be able to build a collider to reach that scale of energy. And even if we reach that energy level, we might create small black hole. This is the current experimental limit on testing and discovering the theory of everything.<br></p><p><b>

Why should we study consciousness? (Max Tegmark)</b><br>Take general relativity for instance, the real genius of Einstein is not the math, but rather figuring out how the observer will experience things. For example, the observer in a spacecraft travelling in a high speed will "feel" the time is slowing down.<br></p><p><b>

Information theory might be an alterative way to define science.</b><br>Science theory is same as "data compression". We develop science theory to describe a tons of things, or behaviors by a small number of equations and constants. For example, the various motions of objects moving in various environment can be described by the Newton's physics. Another example, from quatum mechanics, we can get a tons of variables like wavelength of different lights by putting in three numbers in the quantum mechanic's equations.
<br>Same as math, math has been used to describe the theory of science since its is a way of data compression as well.<br></p><p><b>

What might be the connection between our brain and our physics world?</b><br>Although the current standard model of quantum mechanics is complicated, it is still simple. Let's suppose another universe where each electrons have totally different properties (we have excatly the same quantum number for every electrons in our universe) Then that universe will be too messy and complicated for a brain to understand. If anything looks completely ramdon, then we can't make any predictions, thus why having a brain?
<br>"Maybe there are some region where things are much messier, and that's not where we are. Or maybe there are some deep reason why things are so simple here. I try to be very humble and take seriously that the universe we live is way simpler that it could have been. I think it is telling us something." (Max Tegmark)<br></p></main>
